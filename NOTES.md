*Secure Arch Install*

**Goals**
- The principle of least privilege is absolutely necessary
- Security and convenience must be balanced to make for a usable system
- Implement layers of security, so if one fails, another steps in
- Prep for failure (We're all human)
- User is typically point of failure (Again, we're all human)
- Personal customization and necessary development tooling built-in
- Network and System security features
- Automation is the end goal of this project
